    <h1>Relayed OpenID Relying Party</h1>
    <p>OpenID is a great way to do single sign-on for the web: a user chooses
    to reveal their logged-in status and identity at a given site to other sites
    with just a single click. That’s great, but the premise is that a user can
    exercise discernment over which parties can see their web sign-ons, and this
    is implemented by an OpenID Provider (OP). When you use your Google
    credentials on another site, you’re briefly sent to Google so that you can
    confirm to Google you really do want Google to hand your details over to a
    particular party.
    <p>This is the problem then: Google has to been able to call back to the
    Relying Party (RP). You can't use your Google or Facebook credentials on an
    intranet site, because the webserver has to be visible publicly on the
    internet.
    <p>This servlet is a response to that need. You run the servlet on a public
    address, and servers which are not directly routable on the internet but
    which wish to act as a RP can make a single GET request on the servlet
    to perform the OpenID transaction through the relay.
    <form method="GET" action="api">
    <p>Try it out!
    <p>Request authentication for: <input type="text" name="id">
    </form>
    <h2>Details</h2>
    <p>The servlet is designed to run as a single instance that manages the
    sign-ons for many users individually. Calls to the API should be protected
    in some way beyond the scope of this project. Serving the servlet over
    HTTPS and using BASIC or DIGEST authentication is appropriate. Each user
    is given their own independent store on the servlet, and any service running
    inside the network with access to the user's credentials is able to make
    queries to the servlet on behalf of the user. That is, if one intranet
    server asks the user's Google sign-on status, and another intranet server
    asks about Facebook, each server with the user's credentials can
    subsequently access both sign-on statuses. This is by design.
